# Product Guidelines

## Brand & Voice
- **Tone of Voice:** Professional & Editorial. The interface should use journalistic terminology (e.g., "Draft," "Editorial," "Archive," "Publishing Desk") to reinforce the feeling of a personal publication suite.
- **Messaging:** Clear, concise, and purposeful. Avoid excessive "buddy-like" language; instead, focus on empowering the user as an Editor-in-Chief.

## Visual Identity
- **Color Palette (Warm Editorial):**
  - **Background:** Cream Paper (`#fefae0`)
  - **Primary Accent:** Warm Tan/Caramel (`#d4a373`)
  - **Surface/Cards:** Earthy Sage Green (`#e9edc9`)
  - **Secondary Surface:** Warm Beige (`#faedcd`)
  - **Text:** Dark Brown/Charcoal (`#3D2B1F`) for high readability.
- **Typography:** 
  - **Headings:** Classic Serif (e.g., Playfair Display or Merriweather) to evoke the feel of traditional news headlines.
  - **Body:** Clean Sans-Serif (e.g., Inter) for modern digital legibility.

## Layout & UX
- **Structure:** Modular (Bento Style). Use clean, distinct cards to group related information (e.g., "Upcoming Posts," "AI Suggestions," "Post Preview").
- **Density:** Balanced. Information should be well-organized within modules, providing a comprehensive "at-a-glance" view without feeling cluttered.
- **Consistency:** Use consistent border radii (e.g., `0.5rem` or `1rem`) and subtle shadows to create depth for the modular components.
