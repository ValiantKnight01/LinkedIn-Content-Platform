# Track 3: Newsroom Kanban

**Goal:** Implement the "Newsroom" Kanban board for post lifecycle management.

## 1. Overview
This track focuses on the "Newsroom" tab, implementing a Kanban-style board where users can visualize and manage the progression of their content. It introduces interactive drag-and-drop functionality and simulated AI content generation.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Kanban Board Layout
- **Columns:**
  1.  **Proposed Pool:** Ideas generated by the system.
  2.  **Selected:** Ideas picked for development.
  3.  **In Draft:** Posts currently being written.
  4.  **Scheduled:** Posts ready for publication (Read-only for drag-and-drop).
- **Layout:** Columns are distributed to align with the header actions (`justify-between`), ensuring a balanced look.
- **Scrollable Area:** The board should have a minimum width (e.g., 1200px) and allow horizontal scrolling.

### 2.2 Drag-and-Drop Interaction
- **Library:** Use `@dnd-kit` (Core, Sortable, Utilities).
- **Behavior:**
  - Cards can be dragged between columns.
  - **Optimistic UI:** Cards visually move immediately during drag for better feedback.
  - **Confirmation Dialog:** Moving a card between columns triggers a shadcn/ui `AlertDialog`. Canceling rolls back the state.
  - **Drop Restriction:** Dropping cards into the "Scheduled" column is disabled.
  - Dropping a card updates its status in the store upon confirmation.

### 2.3 Post Cards
... (omitted for brevity)

### 2.4 "Generate Cycle" Simulation
- **UI:** A button in the header "Generate Cycle (Next in 4h)".
- **Action:** Clicking simulates an API call (loading state).
- **Result:** After delay, adds 1-3 new mock cards to the "Proposed Pool" column.

### 2.5 Header
- **Title:** "Editorial Board" (Removed "Today's").

### 2.5 State Management
- **Store:** Update `useNewsroomStore` to handle Kanban columns and card positions.
- **Persistence:** In-memory for now.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Design:** Exact match to reference, with increased border visibility (2px).
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Zustand, @dnd-kit.
- **Performance:** Smooth drag interactions.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Navigating to `/newsroom` shows the Kanban board.
- [x] All 4 columns are present (Proposed, Selected, In Draft, Scheduled).
- [x] Dragging a card between columns updates the store and UI.
- [x] "Generate Cycle" button adds new cards to the first column.
- [x] UI visual fidelity matches the reference (with thicker borders).

## 5. Out of Scope
- Detailed post editor.
- Real backend AI generation.
