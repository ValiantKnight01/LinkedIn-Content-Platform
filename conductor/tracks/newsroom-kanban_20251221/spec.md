# Track 3: Newsroom Kanban

**Goal:** Implement the "Newsroom" Kanban board for post lifecycle management.

## 1. Overview
This track focuses on the "Newsroom" tab, implementing a Kanban-style board where users can visualize and manage the progression of their content. It introduces interactive drag-and-drop functionality and simulated AI content generation.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Kanban Board Layout
- **Columns:**
  1.  **Proposed Pool:** Ideas generated by the system.
  2.  **Selected:** Ideas picked for development.
  3.  **In Draft:** Posts currently being written.
  4.  **Published:** Completed posts.
- **Scrollable Area:** The board should have a minimum width (e.g., 1200px) and allow horizontal scrolling within the main content area.

### 2.2 Drag-and-Drop Interaction
- **Library:** Use `@dnd-kit` (Core, Sortable, Utilities).
- **Behavior:**
  - Cards can be dragged between columns.
  - Visual feedback during drag (lifting, drop placeholders).
  - Dropping a card updates its status in the store.

### 2.3 Post Cards
- **Content:** Title and Icon (representing type: link, forum, or article).
- **Styling:** White background, rounded corners, subtle shadow, "Warm Editorial" typography.
- **Hover Effects:** Slight rotation or lift on hover (as per reference CSS/simulation).

### 2.4 "Generate Cycle" Simulation
- **UI:** A button in the header "Generate Cycle (Next in 4h)".
- **Action:** Clicking simulates an API call (loading state).
- **Result:** After delay, adds 1-3 new mock cards to the "Proposed Pool" column.

### 2.5 State Management
- **Store:** Update `useCalendarStore` (or create a new slice) to handle Kanban columns and card positions.
- **Persistence:** In-memory for now (resets on refresh is fine).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Design:** Exact match to `frontend/references/editorial-view/screen.png` (excluding Skill Group pills).
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Zustand, @dnd-kit.
- **Performance:** Smooth drag interactions (60fps).

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Navigating to `/newsroom` shows the Kanban board.
- [ ] All 4 columns are present with correct headers and counts.
- [ ] Dragging a card between columns updates the store and UI.
- [ ] "Generate Cycle" button adds new cards to the first column.
- [ ] UI visual fidelity matches the reference (colors, fonts, shadows).

## 5. Out of Scope
- Detailed post editor (clicking a card does nothing or logs to console).
- Real backend AI generation.
